## The purpose of this project is a web based application designed to streamline the operations of a bar called **Rum Away Bar**, providing both customers and administrator with a platform to manage reservations, events and iteractions. It features a user friendly interface for users to browse events, make reservations and view testimonials while also offering an admin panel to control various aspects.

### Key features:

- Authentication & Authorization: Secure user authentication and authorization built using Django allauth, allowing users to register, login and manage their accounts.
- Reservation System: Users can create and manage their reservations while preventing them on multiple bookings for the same date.
- Event Management: Admin has full control over event creation and management via the admin panel, including the ability to create - edit - delete events.
- User Profiles & API Integration: API endpoints allow for dynamic content handling, such as profile management and profile images stored secured using Cloudinary.
- Media management: Integration with Cloudinary allows users and admin to upload, store, manage images efficiently.
- Testimonials Section: A dedicated area for users to view and interact with testimonials from other users.
- The platform is built using Django and PostgreSQL.

## User Experience

### Typography & Color scheme

The project uses Roboto and Lato fonts for a clean and modern design. The color scheme consists of:

    Primary Color: #c95a2a (warm orange) 🟠
    Secondary Color: #6d4c41 (rich brown) 🟤
    Background: #f8f2e6 (light beige) 🟡

This palette creates an inviting and cozy atmosphere, fitting for a bar setting, with subtle highlights and shadows adding depth to the design.

### Agile Planning

This project was developed using agile methodologies over a span of approximately four weeks. The development process included the use of various labels such as "documentation" - "good first issue" - "enhancement" to organize tasks and streamline progress. An MVP (Minimum Viable Product) milestone was established to focus on delivering essential features. Each user story is accompanied by a comprehensive set of acceptance criteria, ensuring that all functionalities, including those for the 404 and 505 error pages, are well defined and meet completion standards.

<details>
    <summary><strong>Navigation & Footer</strong></summary>
    <p>
        The navigation bar displays the <strong>Rum Away Bar</strong> text, which serves as an index anchor.
